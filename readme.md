**What social problem is being addressed?**

We will be working in conjunction with KTOWN FOR ALL on their ongoing project regarding closing Western and 7th to create room for a greenspace. Last week, our group met with Adriane Hoff, a KTown Neighborhood Councilmember, to discuss the social problem being addressed by the project. She informed us that the project arises from a need for greater green space in KTown, as it is one of the most park-poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles. We also hope to address inequities in survey design for the project and uplift community narratives in our final project.

**What problems might arise in developing this application?**

Developing this crowd-sourced mapping application could present such issues as the inherent biases within our data and difficulty in reconciling data from different sources. Another problem that could arise during our project process could be the language barrier between our group and the Korean constituents who we hope to collect data and narratives from regarding the project. Hopefully we can seek out the assistance of our Korean-speaking friends to develop a survey that adequately collects the stories of Korean constituents and their feelings about the project!
