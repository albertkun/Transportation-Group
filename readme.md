**Technology Used for the Project**

For our project, we utilized Microsoft Forms as well as Leaflet. The Microsoft Form was used to collect community survey responses and data regarding folks' opinions on the "Reimagining 6th" proposal. Leaflet was used to exhibit the responses to our survey and empower community narratives. We specifcally showcased the data for the responses to Question 7 of our survey, which asked responders which community problems they felt were most prevalent in Koreatown and how certain amenities could be incorporated into the "Reimagining 6th" proposal to address those issues.

**How It Could Be Used in the Future**

We hope for this technology and mapplication to be used in the future to collect authentic community narratives regarding the "Reimagining 6th" proposal. We intend for the survey responses to be taken into consideration by the Koreatown Neighborhood Council in their construction of a reimagined 6th street. We also hope that the map will continue to identify locations that are meaningful to Koreatown community members and encourage those in charge of the project to preserve and empower these sites.


**What social problem is being addressed?**

We will be working in conjunction with Streets FOR ALL on their ongoing project regarding closing Alexandria and 6th to create room for a greenspace. Last week, our group met with Adriane Hoff, a KTown Neighborhood Councilmember, to discuss the social problem being addressed by the project. She informed us that the project arises from a need for greater green space in KTown, as it is one of the most park-poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles. We also hope to address inequities in survey design for the project and uplift community narratives in our final project. Here is the current websie regarding the project and its intentions: https://wcknc.la/6thst/.

**What problems might arise in developing this application?**

Developing this crowd-sourced mapping application could present such issues as the inherent biases within our data and difficulty in reconciling data from different sources. Another problem that could arise during our project process could be the language barrier between our group and the Korean constituents who we hope to collect data and narratives from regarding the project. Hopefully we can seek out the assistance of our Korean-speaking friends to develop a survey that adequately collects the stories of Korean constituents and their feelings about the project!
